# YouTube-Scraping              <img src="https://github.com/m0-k1/YouTube-Scrapping/blob/master/image/yt_1200.jpg" width="100">

 In this repository, I have showcased my scraping ability by scraping [YouTube](www.youtube.com). :smile:
 
 ## Approach Used - : :thinking:
 
* First I collected more than 500 links from youtube search page. Used Selenium for automation process. 
* Saved the links in a seperate file. Saving up the links will allow one not to collect links over and over again. :nerd_face:
* Then searched through each link and extracted the following - Video Title, Video Views, Uploading Date, Likes on that video, Dislikes on the video and Comments.
* Coverted the data into a DataFrame and Saved the result in csv format. 
* Being this a scrapper, care has been taken if there are connection problems and will save up the data collected prior to the connection problem or other problems.
* A tip for those who want to scrap sites like YouTube -
          
        Scrapping comments section will take a really long time if there are many comments. Be careful while scrapping those.    
        Always save your progress time to time as no one wants to start all over again, especially when you are playing a video game.

Finally, I have made a dataset of 500+ links with the above data is uploaded in this repository. Do check it out!!:sunglasses:
